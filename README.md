# A* search algorithm
  This repo contains the implementation of A* search algorithm. As a reminder, this is the best algorithm in many cases to find
the best first path from a source to target in a graph for example. For more information,
see https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/A*_search_algorithm
 
# Case study
  I apply A* search algorithm to determine a best first path from Arad to Bucharest based on this map.

  Like heuristic's function for my A star's implementation, I choose "Straight-line heuristic"
  
# Running test
  ```bash
  python a_star_example.py
  ```
